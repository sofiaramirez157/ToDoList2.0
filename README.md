Mark the tasks as completed, with objects in Java, first I will create two attributes for my class in this case it will be, name and if it is checked, I make a constructor and Getter and Setter, then I create an Array and Scanner method, I add my list, with false because none is completed, then I perform a for for my array and an IF/else, because I will mark a number and it will come out completed if it is outside the numbers that I enter it will say invalid index.
