## Project: Task Organizer in Java

### Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a console application in Java that allows users to manage a task list (ToDo list). The application will enable users to perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks. The development will follow non-object-oriented programming principles, using primitive data structures and functions.

### Roles
- **Stakeholders:** María and Diego from F5
- **Product Owner:** Hilmar
- **Scrum Master:** Jose Manuel
- **Development Team:**
  - Fran
  - Jose Manuel
  - Hilmar
  - Sofía

### Sprint Goals (Due June 6)
- **CRUD Functionality:**
  - **Add Task:** Jose Manuel
  - **Delete Task:** Fran
  - **List Tasks:** Sofía
  - **Mark Task as Completed:** Hilmar
  - **Exit:** Sofía

### Expected Deliverables
- **GitHub Repository:** Containing the project code with a comprehensive README file.
- **Kanban Board:** Managed in Trello (or another suitable tool) to track project tasks and progress.
- **Bonus:** Documentation and Guide for First Steps in the App

### Performance Criteria
- The application should function correctly in the console, allowing users to:
  - Add new tasks.
  - Delete existing tasks by specifying their index.
  - List all tasks, indicating which are completed and which are not.
  - Mark tasks as completed by specifying their index.
  - Exit the application.
